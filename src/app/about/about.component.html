              I love to build awesome stuff, this is one of the things why I love coding because it gives
              me the ability to build. One of the things that makes me love coding also is problem solving.

            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              I started learning when I was 14, I wanted
              to create a website for my Facebook page and I has no idea on what the programming is, actually I didn’t
              know that there’s something called programming. So, I started googling on how to build a website and one
              thing let to another and I found myself learning how to create a blog using Blogger. And when I created my
              first blog, I want to edit a lot of things in the template and make my website even better, so I started
              learning how to edit these templates using HTML and CSS and till then I had no idea what the programming
              is. Till I encountered with a Visual Basic course, I watched it with passion and I always wanted more. And
              when my 6 years older brother saw me building these apps, he introduced me to computer science area and
              told me that I can work in this area and become a developer. So, he made me even more passionate for
              learning, and when I grow up, I went to the college to major in Computer Science.
